Apparently-To:
if there is a bunch of "Apparently-To" headers probably it's a spam
Message-id:
check validity of message_id in that field (*@*.*)
In-Reply-To:
check validity of message_id in that field (*@*.*)
Received:
1st - validate addresses (Example: "Received: from (1)fbi.gov ((2)spamer.com[202.132.11.48]) by mail.simpleuser.ru...")
(2) comes from postback to DNS, so you need to check if (1) equals to (2)
2nd - check if "chain breaks" Example:
"""
Received: from B ([202.132.11.48]) by A (8.8.5)...

Received: from C ([1.1.1.1]) by B (8.8.3/8.7.2)...

Received: from D ([1.1.1.1]) by G (8.8.3/8.7.2)... (This breaks the chain)
....
"""
Reply-to:
need to check if provided address exists (can't do it)
X-Mailer:
need to make black list of mailer programs used by spamers and filter messages using it
Return-path:, From:
email from return-path should be equal to "from:"
To, Bcc, Cc:
there should be our email
